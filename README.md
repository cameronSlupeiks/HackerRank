# Hacker Rank Challenges 👨‍💻
Here, you can find my solution set to daily challenges completed on Hacker Rank. I started these daily challenges because:
1) I want to improve my work-related skillset
2) I want to learn new programming concepts
3) Coding is bomb AF 💣

## Categories

Challenges are sorted based on the following categories:

1) Languages (ie. Language Proficiency)
2) Data Structures (Coming Soon)
3) Mathematics (Coming Soon)
4) AI (Coming Soon)
5) Databases (Coming Soon)
6) Security (Coming Soon)

However, you will need to create your own test cases for most of these challenges. If you don't want to do this,
I have attached links to each of the problems.
